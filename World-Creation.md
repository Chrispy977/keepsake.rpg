# World Creation
Worlds are what contains characters as defined in the **Character Creation** guide.

Worlds are a self-contained universe. Experienced **World Masters** or **WM**s can craft stories to include multiverse campaigns. However, for most games this would not apply. 

Worlds are defined by the following:

- Environment
- NPCs
- Economy
- Combatants
- Jobs
- Epics
- Epochs or Ages

The remainder of this guide will review the aformentioned definitions of a World.

## Environment

This defines the topology of the world as well as the infrastructure. It's best to keep things small and contained to keep the Epics in scope but any size is possible. 

Environment matters in Keepsake. Different positions can mean the difference between failure and success. 

## NPCs

Any character that is not included in the player's party. Jobs and Epics are spawned by these characters. 

## Economy

This defines how the currency will behave in the world. It is open to interpretation and any system is allowed.

## Combatants

Any character that is in direct opposition to a Job or Epic.

## Jobs

These are simple goals set out by NPCs not directly involved with any epic. 

## Epics

Epics are a string of specific goals that need to be acheived by a party of characters. 

## Epochs or Ages

All previously mentioned attributes of a world can be changed by Epochs and/or Ages. It is the only way to fundamentally chage a world.
